#Speech-To-Audio-Converter

This repository contains code for Speech To Audio Converter using tex-to-speech along with python tkinter gui interface. If you want to 
test the code, run AudioToText.py file. 

Technology used: - Python -tkinter GUI interface, gTTS - Text-to-Speech, SpeechRecognition

Working - 

When we run AudioToText.py file, the shell window opens and ask you to "Say Now". After that your voice will be fetched. Similiarly this
piece of action will be repeated one more time to get the second audio. Once both the audios are recorded, a separate file name 'Merged' 
will be saved containing the concatenated audio of Audio 1 and Audio 2 respectively.

You can either work with first audio or the second as it will also store both the audios separately.

Incase you don't want to work with audio, all you want is to convert your speech into the text; just complete your initial part and then
copy your required text. It will save a lot of time in typing and provides great efficiency.
